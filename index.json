It compares an intervention to another intervention (or the absence of intervention) by estimating how much it costs to gain a unit of a desired health outcome such as a year of life gained, a case of disease cured, or a life saved. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides information on health impacts and costs of an intervention compared to an alternative intervention (or the absence of intervention). Results are presented as a cost-effectiveness ratio which is the is the cost of an intervention divided by changes in health outcomes. Examples include cost per year of life gained, cost per case cured, and cost per life saved. Interventions can then be compared in terms of cost per unit of effectiveness. This handbook covers the types of outcomes used in CEA analyses, the creation of counterfactuals to model the absence of an intervention, building models of program outcomes and costs, accounting for uncertainty in models using fuzzy numbers and fuzzy arithmetic, the types of costs that need to be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses, detailed methods and tools needed to collect and work with costs data from a variety of sources, and guidance on interpreting cost-effectiveness estimates.

OxCGRT makes available systematic information in a consistent way, aiding those who require information have access to it efficiently. This package facilitates access to the OxCGRT data for R users via version 2 of its API. This package also includes functions to calculate the various OxCGRT indices in R. This package is aimed at R users who use or plan to use the OxCGRT data for their research or for other academic purposes or who develop or want to develop other metrics or indices that build on the OxCGRT approach.\nWhat does oxcgrt do? The oxcgrt package has two main sets of functions that:\nRetrieve OxCGRT data (get_* functions) via version 2 of its API; and,\nCalculate various OxCGRT indicators, sub-indices and indices (calculate_* functions).\nThere are other R packages that provide access to data from the OxCGRT. The COVID19 package and the oxcovid19 package are just two examples of these. However, all these packages provide access to the OxCGRT data as data dumps and only for the time-series of the stringency index per country. To our knowledge, the oxcgrt package is the only R package currently that provides an interface to the available API for querying and retrieving data. Also, the oxcgrt package provides functions to calculate the OxCGRT sub-indices and indices based on their methodology.

The Philippines COVID-19 Data Drop is distributed via Google Drive with latest updated data provided daily (generally). Data from previous days are archived and also made available through Google Drive. This package provides a coherent, robust and performant API to the latest and archived Philippines COVID-19 data.\nMotivation and development history In early April 2020 as part of CoMo Philippines’s contribution to the CoMo Consortium’s work in COVID-19 modelling for the Philippines context, we developed an R package called comoparams that provided R functions for access, handling and processing of relevant data required for COVID-19 modelling parameters for the Philippines. Within the comoparams package was a set of functions developed to interface with the then newly-announced Philippines Department of Health Data Drop for COVID-19. From then until late June 2020, we continued maintenance of the comoparams package. Specifically, the set of functions for interfacing with the DoH Data Drop required several functions updates (see history of issues and changes to the package here) in relation to noted issues with the DoH Data Drop system and the data it provides. A good discussion of some of these issues by the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team can be found here. Other issues that required syntax-breaking changes to the comoparams package functions were related to how the DoH Data Drop was released and distributed. Earlier during its first release, the DoH Data Drop was distributed through Google Sheets via a single non-changing link. This was for both latest release and the archived data. A few weeks later, the DoH Data Drop was moved to Google Drive again via a single non-changing link for both the latest and the archive data. A month or so after, release of the latest DoH Data Drop was distributed through a single link that changed during every release (usually daily). The archive data, on the other hand, was distributed through a different but constant link. The DoH Data Drop distribution system has since remained as such up to date though the archive data now only includes the current month archive compared to what it was in late June 2020 when all previous months of archive data were available.\nCurrently, given the still persistent issues raised with regard to the DoH Data Drop system and the datasets it distributes, we felt it was important to create a separate focused R package just for accessing, handling and processing of the DoH Data Drop that can be universally used by other R users regardless of their ultimate end-use for the data (e.g., reporting, visualisation, modelling, etc.). We also wanted to contribute to the work of fellow scientists and researchers in the Philippines whom we are familiar with and whom we know use R for the epidemiologic analysis work they perform which they share with the general public in the Philippines. From our own experiences of dealing with the DoH Data Drop, we felt that it would be extremely helpful for fellow scientists and researchers who use R to have consistent and performant data access, handling and processing functions to interface with the DoH Data Drop that can potentially reduce the daily and/or weekly workload of producing COVID-19 analysis and reports and streamline their routine analytical workflows.\nTo this end, we took inspiration from the functions we developed in the comoparams package and developed this covidphdata package based on the following R package design principles:\nuse of a modular and refactorable approach to determining and developing the functions required;\ncreation of an R-based robust and performant application programme interface or API to the Google Drive-based DoH Data Drop;\napplication of modern data handling and processing techniques available in R; and,\noutput of coherent and compliant data structures ready for various applications.\nFinally, we want to contribute to both the public discourse and to the practice of open data and open science in the Philippines and encourage others to do the same. Our group’s codebase for our work on COVID-19 modelling (primarily in R language for statistical computing) is available publicly via GitHub including the one for the covidphdata package (see https://github.com/como-ph/covidphdata). Our hope is that by creating this package and making its use available to all R users and its codebase open source, we can standardise accessing, handling and processing of the DoH Data Drop thereby providing transparency to the approaches applied to the data before it is analysed or visualised.\nWhat does covidphdatado? The covidphdata primarily provides functions that serve as low-level wrappers to specific googledrive package functions that support the access to files and folders contained in a Google Drive given that the DoH Data Drop is distributed through this platform.\nCurrently, the covidphdata package:\nProvides functions (datadrop_id*) to dynamically retrieve unique DoH Data Drop file and folder identifiers used by Google Drive;\nProvides a function (datadrop_ls) to list the files and folders within a specified DoH Data Drop folder in Google Drive;\nProvides a function (datadrop_download) to download a specified file within DoH Data Drop in Google Drive; and,\nProvides functions (datadrop_get) to retrieve a specified file within DoH Data Drop in Google Drive into R.\nTo learn more about the covidphdata package - how to install in R, how to use the package, and how to contribute to its development and testing - visit the package website at https://como-ph.github.io/covidphdata.\n","date":1606005000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606008600,"objectID":"5fd284813bef9ccec2b6f4cf2a8b37aa","permalink":"https://ernest.guevarra.io/post/interface-doh-covid19-data-drop/","publishdate":"2020-11-22T00:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/interface-doh-covid19-data-drop/","section":"post","summary":"An R package providing a coherent, robust and performant API to the Philippines COVID-19 data","tags":["covid19","R","Philippines","CoMo-PH"],"title":"covidphdata: An Interface to the Philippines Department of Health COVID-19 Data Drop","type":"post"},{"authors":["ernestguevarra"],"categories":["Reflections"],"content":" I didn’t realise how much I would be affected by the current and continuing struggle of Reina Mae as a political detainee arrested based on suspicious charges of unlawful possession of firearms and explosives and as a grieving mother of three-month old Baby River whom she gave birth to while in custody, separated from her after a month and who just recently died of pneumonia.\nI’ve experienced a rush of memories from 20 years back when I was still a medical student in my clerkship and internship years. Whenever I was not on duty on a Saturday or a Sunday, I joined a health and human rights organisation in their routine outreach work to political detainees still languishing in prison. I usually worked alongside the organisation’s senior doctor or nurse in looking after the general health and well-being of the political detainees as they awaited their cases and appeals for release to be heard by the courts or for a decision for their release to be made. But more than the health checks that I helped in providing for them, it was the visit itself from our group that made all the difference for the political detainees - a reaffirmation that their colleagues and brothers and sisters in the struggle have not forgotten and continue to represent and advocate for them to be appropriately recognised as political detainees rather than common criminals and thus be afforded their rights as such.\nAs a young person and just about to finish medical school, the little that I have been able to contribute to help them in their struggle was returned to me through a wealth of learning of the political work that they did and its importance in the bigger struggle for a more just and fair society and country. They afforded me with their camaraderie and kinship sharing their sadness for not being with their family and not seeing their children grow, their grief for loved ones who’ve passed whom they have not had the chance to be with prior, but also their continued optimism for their eventual release.\nFast forward 20 years of finding my own causes and hopefully contributing my own share to the bigger struggle for a just and fair society as a public health practitioner, I am struck to my core after reading about the callousness and the indignity of what Reina Mae and Baby River have been made to endure. This has brought out an anger inside me that I thought I’ve been able to let go. An anger that is shared by so many others within the Philippines including fellow health professionals.\nNelson Mandela has once said that, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Let us not let the few in our society who chose to ignore the needs and rights of Baby River and separated her from her mother, Reina Mae who has equally been denied her rights, define who we are as a society. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n","date":1602981000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602981000,"objectID":"119047604c91f5cf382ae7fccdc2563a","permalink":"https://ernest.guevarra.io/post/do-not-go-gentle-into-that-good-night/","publishdate":"2020-10-18T00:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/do-not-go-gentle-into-that-good-night/","section":"post","summary":"There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children. - Nelson Mandela","tags":["Philippines","human rights"],"title":"Do not go gentle into that good night","type":"post"},{"authors":["ernestguevarra"],"categories":["Announcement"],"content":" katilingban - [ka-ti-ling-ban]: (n.) A Cebuano word meaning 1) a group or a community of people; 2) society, organisation or club.\nIt is at times of extreme social struggle and difficulty that we are reminded of the primacy of the collective and the value of working towards the common good. The current global health crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic along with the social upheaval caused by the continuing and persistent racial injustice in the United States recently sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and which has grown into a worldwide Black Lives Matter movement are the signs of the times. And these are the times when the power of collective action towards the common good is even more crucial.\nIt is against this backdrop that I, together with three other colleagues, have founded Katilingban, a collective of multi-disciplinary experts and practitioners in public health and nutrition. Though coming from different nationalities and diverse backgrounds and experiences, one of our main commonalities is our community-based orientation - from a doctor who ran a community-based mental health programme for civil war-affected children and youth in the Philippines, to a public health practitioner who studies and works with communities to understand their context to inform health and nutrition programming, to a community health and nutrition expert who has performed multiple coverage assessments and evaluations of community-based nutrition programmes in the past decade illustrating how the community aspect of these programmes has mostly been poorly done, and to a nutrition data expert who has implemented numerous nutrition surveys to aid in the design and planning of nutrition programmes advocating for more community participation in programme design and planning. And it is this community-based orientation that inspired us to form our own collective, to form Katilingban.\nFor the remainder of 2020, we would like to once again emphasise the importance of coverage of health and nutrition programming more so in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted health and nutrition in more ways than just the infection itself. The global focus on COVID-19 has potentially further widened disparities in other health and nutrition outcomes particularly in low and middle income countries through a variety of mechanisms. We would like to collaborate with other organisations and researchers who are keen on assessing the impact of the pandemic on various aspects of health and nutrition in low and middle income countries. And given the limitations posed by the pandemic, we would like to explore the use of relatively new or less utilised modalities of primary data collection and to test and utilise other analytical techniques on already existing secondary data and routine programme data taht would allow us to still examine and understand the on-going health and nutrition situation other than COVID-19.\nInterested in collaborating?
