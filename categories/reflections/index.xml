&lt;p&gt;One would be hard-pressed to think of any other event or phenomenon more universally experienced by Filipinos than a cyclone or what we call &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;bagyo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (pronounced /baɡˈjo/, [bɐɡˈjo]). My earliest memory related to cyclones was when I was 4 years old and my older brother and I were put into an empty plastic drum to float above flood waters pushed along by our mother. My mother recounts how happy and excited my brother and I was being inside that drum, oblivious to the strong gusts of wind and heavy rains outside. She did her best to steady the drum and shield us from the wind and rain while she waded through chest-deep flood waters to get to a place of refuge. As I grew up, cyclones would provide interesting chapters into my formative years. I still recall the joy of having school cancelled when the incoming cyclone was determined to be too strong and potentially unsafe followed by an immediate realisation that I would just end up being stuck at home and unable to play because of the harsh conditions outside and the constant possibility of flooding. In my second year of medical school, I volunteered to live in a small remote fishing village in the main northern island of the Philippines. The village lies along the usual path of cyclones that develop on the Philippine Sea to the east. As to be expected, midway into my time there was when I experienced the raw power of cyclones. Over a three-day period, two typhoon category cyclones made landfall near the area of the fishing village and with the eye of the storm, the spot with the lowest pressure and fastest sustained wind speed, passing very close by. This was very transformative and made the experiences of those in the margins - whether physical, social, or economical - tangible and real for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, having lived almost half of my lifetime outside of the Philippines, I have gone places where I’ve experienced other life-changing and values-defining events and phenomenon. These, along with my cyclones experience, continue to shape and inform my notion and understanding of fairness, diversity, and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is from this background that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://panukatan.io/bagyo&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; R package&lt;/a&gt; was borne out of. Just like a songwriter’s lyrics and melody for a dearly beloved or a poet’s ode to their muse, this package is a nod to my youth and a loving embrace to my motherland. I’ve always thought of how good it would be to have a dataset that I, and others like me, will be able to relate to. And today the &lt;a href=&#34;https://panukatan.io/bagyo&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; R package&lt;/a&gt; has just been released on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;. I hope this dataset can be an adjunct to the well-established &lt;a href=&#34;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iris&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dataset and to the currently popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;palmerpenguins&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;about-the-bagyo-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; package contains the &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; dataset. This dataset was taken from annual reports on Philippine tropical cyclones prepared and released by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;PAGASA&lt;/a&gt; at its &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical-cyclone/publications/annual-report&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the reports are in PDF format and the information described above are in tables within the documents, scripts for scraping the desired data were developed and implemented to arrive at the &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; dataset. The data scraping script can be viewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panukatan/bagyo/blob/main/data-raw/process_data.R&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following information is available from the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;category_code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Tropical cyclone category code&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;category_name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Tropical cyclone category name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Name given to the tropical cyclone by Philippine authorities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;rsmc_name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Name given to the tropical cyclone by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Date and time at which cyclone enters Philippine area of responsibility (PAR)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Date and time at which cyclone leaves Philippine area of responsibility (PAR)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Maximum central pressure in &lt;em&gt;hPa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Maximum sustained wind speed in &lt;em&gt;km/h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This metadata can be viewed in R through a call to &lt;code&gt;?bagyo&lt;/code&gt; in the R console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst tropical cyclones have affected the Philippines far earlier than 2017 and more currently than 2020, official and publicly available data for the information described above is only available in the reports for years 2017 to 2020. Earlier documents of this annual reporting pre-2017 have been produced but are not available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;PAGASA&lt;/a&gt; website. These reports of the tropical cyclone season (re-started in 2019) are published within two years after the termination of the season. Hence, the most recent report is only up to 2020 for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that reports for 2021 onwards will continue to be published and made available by PAGASA. As such, the &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; package and the &lt;code&gt;bagyo&lt;/code&gt; dataset within it will be updated accordingly. Continued efforts are also being taken to find sources of information for years preceding 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do not go gentle into that good night</title>

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t realise how much I would be affected by the current and continuing struggle of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54519788&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reina Mae&lt;/strong&gt; as a political detainee arrested based on suspicious charges of unlawful possession of firearms and explosives and as a grieving mother of three-month old &lt;strong&gt;Baby River&lt;/strong&gt; whom she gave birth to while in custody, separated from her after a month and who just recently died of pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve experienced a rush of memories from 20 years back when I was still a medical student in my clerkship and internship years. Whenever I was not on duty on a Saturday or a Sunday, I joined a health and human rights organisation in their routine outreach work to political detainees still languishing in prison. I usually worked alongside the organisation’s senior doctor or nurse in looking after the general health and well-being of the political detainees as they awaited their cases and appeals for release to be heard by the courts or for a decision for their release to be made. But more than the health checks that I helped in providing for them, it was the visit itself from our group that made all the difference for the political detainees - a reaffirmation that their colleagues and brothers and sisters in the struggle have not forgotten and continue to represent and advocate for them to be appropriately recognised as political detainees rather than common criminals and thus be afforded their rights as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young person and just about to finish medical school, the little that I have been able to contribute to help them in their struggle was returned to me through a wealth of learning of the political work that they did and its importance in the bigger struggle for a more just and fair society and country. They afforded me with their camaraderie and kinship sharing their sadness for not being with their family and not seeing their children grow, their grief for loved ones who’ve passed whom they have not had the chance to be with prior, but also their continued optimism for their eventual release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 20 years of finding my own causes and hopefully contributing my own share to the bigger struggle for a just and fair society as a public health practitioner, I am struck to my core after reading about the callousness and the indignity of what Reina Mae and Baby River have been made to endure. This has brought out an anger inside me that I thought I’ve been able to let go. An anger that is shared by so many others within the Philippines including fellow health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson Mandela has once said that, &lt;em&gt;“There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.”&lt;/em&gt; Let us not let the few in our society who chose to ignore the needs and rights of Baby River and separated her from her mother, Reina Mae who has equally been denied her rights, define who we are as a society. &lt;strong&gt;Rage, rage against the dying of the light&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
