&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doh.gov.ph&#34;&gt;Philippines Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; has made COVID-19 related data publicly available as part of its mandate to promoting transparency and accountability in governance. The Philippines COVID-19 Data Drop is distributed via &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt; with latest updated data provided daily (generally). Data from previous days are archived and also made available through &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;. This package provides a coherent, robust and performant API to the latest and archived Philippines COVID-19 data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;motivation-and-development-history&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation and development history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April 2020 as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io&#34;&gt;CoMo Philippines&lt;/a&gt;’s contribution to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context&#34;&gt;CoMo Consortium&lt;/a&gt;’s work in COVID-19 modelling for the Philippines context, we developed an &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; package called &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io/comoparams&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comoparams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provided &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; functions for access, handling and processing of relevant data required for COVID-19 modelling parameters for the Philippines. Within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io/comoparams&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comoparams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package was a set of functions developed to interface with the then &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDOHgov/posts/announcement-covid-19-data-drop-now-accessible-onlinecovid-19-related-data-now-a/3227811310563432/&#34;&gt;newly-announced Philippines Department of Health Data Drop for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. From then until late June 2020, we continued maintenance of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io/comoparams&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comoparams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package. Specifically, the set of functions for interfacing with the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; required several functions updates (see history of issues and changes to the package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/como-ph/comoparams/issues?q=is%3Aissue&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) in relation to noted issues with the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; system and the data it provides. A good discussion of some of these issues by the &lt;strong&gt;UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team&lt;/strong&gt; can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.up.edu.ph/prevailing-data-issues-in-the-time-of-covid-19-and-the-need-for-open-data/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Other issues that required syntax-breaking changes to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io/comoparams&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comoparams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package functions were related to how the DoH Data Drop was released and distributed. Earlier during its first release, the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; was distributed through &lt;em&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/em&gt; via a single non-changing link. This was for both latest release and the archived data. A few weeks later, the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; was moved to &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt; again via a single non-changing link for both the latest and the archive data. A month or so after, release of the latest &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; was distributed through a single link that changed during every release (usually daily). The archive data, on the other hand, was distributed through a different but constant &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/DataDropArchives&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; distribution system has since remained as such up to date though the archive data now only includes the current month archive compared to what it was in late June 2020 when all previous months of archive data were available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, given the still persistent issues raised with regard to the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; system and the datasets it distributes, we felt it was important to create a separate focused &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; package just for accessing, handling and processing of the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; that can be universally used by other &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; users regardless of their ultimate end-use for the data (e.g., reporting, visualisation, modelling, etc.). We also wanted to contribute to the work of fellow scientists and researchers in the Philippines whom we are familiar with and whom we know use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; for the epidemiologic analysis work they perform which they share with the general public in the Philippines. From our own experiences of dealing with the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt;, we felt that it would be extremely helpful for fellow scientists and researchers who use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; to have consistent and performant data access, handling and processing functions to interface with the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; that can potentially reduce the daily and/or weekly workload of producing COVID-19 analysis and reports and streamline their routine analytical workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, we took inspiration from the functions we developed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://como-ph.github.io/comoparams&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;comoparams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package and developed this &lt;code&gt;covidphdata&lt;/code&gt; package based on the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; package design principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use of a &lt;strong&gt;modular and refactorable approach&lt;/strong&gt; to determining and developing the functions required;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;creation of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;strong&gt;robust and performant application programme interface or API&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;-based &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;application of &lt;strong&gt;modern data handling and processing techniques&lt;/strong&gt; available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;; and,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;output of &lt;strong&gt;coherent and compliant data structures&lt;/strong&gt; ready for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to contribute to both the &lt;em&gt;public discourse&lt;/em&gt; and to the &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;open data&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;open science&lt;/strong&gt; in the Philippines and encourage others to do the same. Our group’s codebase for our work on COVID-19 modelling (primarily in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; language for statistical computing) is available publicly via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/como-ph&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; including the one for the &lt;code&gt;covidphdata&lt;/code&gt; package (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/como-ph/covidphdata&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/como-ph/covidphdata&lt;/a&gt;). Our hope is that by creating this package and making its use available to all &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; users and its codebase open source, we can standardise accessing, handling and processing of the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; thereby providing transparency to the approaches applied to the data before it is analysed or visualised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-does-covidphdatado&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does &lt;code&gt;covidphdata&lt;/code&gt;do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;covidphdata&lt;/code&gt; primarily provides functions that serve as low-level wrappers to specific &lt;a href=&#34;http://googledrive.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;googledrive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package functions that support the access to files and folders contained in a &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt; given that the &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; is distributed through this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the &lt;code&gt;covidphdata&lt;/code&gt; package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides functions (&lt;code&gt;datadrop_id*&lt;/code&gt;) to dynamically retrieve unique &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; file and folder identifiers used by &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides a function (&lt;code&gt;datadrop_ls&lt;/code&gt;) to list the files and folders within a specified &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; folder in &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides a function (&lt;code&gt;datadrop_download&lt;/code&gt;) to download a specified file within &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt;; and,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides functions (&lt;code&gt;datadrop_get&lt;/code&gt;) to retrieve a specified file within &lt;strong&gt;DoH Data Drop&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Google Drive&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Do not go gentle into that good night</title>
      <link>https://ernest.guevarra.io/post/do-not-go-gentle-into-that-good-night/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t realise how much I would be affected by the current and continuing struggle of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54519788&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reina Mae&lt;/strong&gt; as a political detainee arrested based on suspicious charges of unlawful possession of firearms and explosives and as a grieving mother of three-month old &lt;strong&gt;Baby River&lt;/strong&gt; whom she gave birth to while in custody, separated from her after a month and who just recently died of pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve experienced a rush of memories from 20 years back when I was still a medical student in my clerkship and internship years. Whenever I was not on duty on a Saturday or a Sunday, I joined a health and human rights organisation in their routine outreach work to political detainees still languishing in prison. I usually worked alongside the organisation’s senior doctor or nurse in looking after the general health and well-being of the political detainees as they awaited their cases and appeals for release to be heard by the courts or for a decision for their release to be made. But more than the health checks that I helped in providing for them, it was the visit itself from our group that made all the difference for the political detainees - a reaffirmation that their colleagues and brothers and sisters in the struggle have not forgotten and continue to represent and advocate for them to be appropriately recognised as political detainees rather than common criminals and thus be afforded their rights as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young person and just about to finish medical school, the little that I have been able to contribute to help them in their struggle was returned to me through a wealth of learning of the political work that they did and its importance in the bigger struggle for a more just and fair society and country. They afforded me with their camaraderie and kinship sharing their sadness for not being with their family and not seeing their children grow, their grief for loved ones who’ve passed whom they have not had the chance to be with prior, but also their continued optimism for their eventual release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 20 years of finding my own causes and hopefully contributing my own share to the bigger struggle for a just and fair society as a public health practitioner, I am struck to my core after reading about the callousness and the indignity of what Reina Mae and Baby River have been made to endure. This has brought out an anger inside me that I thought I’ve been able to let go. An anger that is shared by so many others within the Philippines including fellow health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson Mandela has once said that, &lt;em&gt;“There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.”&lt;/em&gt; Let us not let the few in our society who chose to ignore the needs and rights of Baby River and separated her from her mother, Reina Mae who has equally been denied her rights, define who we are as a society. &lt;strong&gt;Rage, rage against the dying of the light&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We are Katilingban</title>
      <link>https://ernest.guevarra.io/post/we-are-katilingban/</link>

      <description>


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;katilingban&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;[ka-ti-ling-ban]&lt;/em&gt;: (n.) A Cebuano word meaning 1) a group or a community of people; 2) society, organisation or club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at times of extreme social struggle and difficulty that we are reminded of the &lt;em&gt;primacy of the collective&lt;/em&gt; and the value of working towards the &lt;em&gt;common good&lt;/em&gt;. The current global health crisis brought about by the &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt; pandemic along with the social upheaval caused by the continuing and persistent racial injustice in the United States recently sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and which has grown into a worldwide &lt;strong&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/strong&gt; movement are the signs of the times. And these are the times when the power of collective action towards the common good is even more crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against this backdrop that I, together with three other colleagues, have founded &lt;strong&gt;Katilingban&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a collective of multi-disciplinary experts and practitioners in public health and nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Though coming from different nationalities and diverse backgrounds and experiences, one of our main commonalities is our community-based orientation - from a doctor who ran a community-based mental health programme for civil war-affected children and youth in the Philippines, to a public health practitioner who studies and works with communities to understand their context to inform health and nutrition programming, to a community health and nutrition expert who has performed multiple coverage assessments and evaluations of community-based nutrition programmes in the past decade illustrating how the community aspect of these programmes has mostly been poorly done, and to a nutrition data expert who has implemented numerous nutrition surveys to aid in the design and planning of nutrition programmes advocating for more community participation in programme design and planning. And it is this community-based orientation that inspired us to form our own collective, to form &lt;strong&gt;Katilingban&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of 2020, we would like to once again emphasise the importance of coverage of health and nutrition programming more so in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted health and nutrition in more ways than just the infection itself. The global focus on COVID-19 has potentially further widened disparities in other health and nutrition outcomes particularly in low and middle income countries through a variety of mechanisms. We would like to collaborate with other organisations and researchers who are keen on assessing the impact of the pandemic on various aspects of health and nutrition in low and middle income countries. And given the limitations posed by the pandemic, we would like to explore the use of relatively new or less utilised modalities of primary data collection and to test and utilise other analytical techniques on already existing secondary data and routine programme data taht would allow us to still examine and understand the on-going health and nutrition situation other than COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in collaborating? &lt;a href=&#34;https://katilingban.io/#contact&#34;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;
